Description: I have used google-colab to run my code and so for submitting i was not sure whehter to submit ipynb file or py file so in order to that I have added both the file so that it would be helpfull for you to check my code and my project doesn't have any major dependencies to download. In my project first I have implemented the Random forest which has some accuracy of 94% and I have assumed this value as my do nothing value. And then I have used the strateergies which are mentioned as the strategies in my rough draft and then I have implemented strategy 1 which is Resampling Technique and Cost-sensitive learning, and then the second strategy which is Interquartile Range and trimming , and the Last strategy which is the third one in which I have implemented Min-max Scaling and standardization. To compare all the three strategy I have calculated the Mean squared error, Mean Absolute error and then R-squared error.
